Note that the assignment has been pushed to the branch named "pycaret_expt_3". Also, the commit was made before running the server.

The file named "utility.ipynb" was an attempt to train complete blended and tuned models that I could not do in Week 3 due to problems with Colab and can be considered for Week 3 instead of here. Also, logging was tried in the "utility.ipynb" notebook instead of the main notebook inside src.
